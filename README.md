# ReturningRandomWalk
Project for computations and simulations concerning returning-random-walks on graphs and transition matrices

This project contains:
- a **Graph** class to represent weighted graphs, initialize graphs from adjacency matrices and create adjacency matrices vise versa
- a **GraphWalker** class to simulate returning random walks
- a **GraphPrinter** class to print graphs as png- and dot-files
- a **Matrix** class to effectivly compute Matrix operations, store and load matrices
- a **MatPowerSeries** class to compute any matrix power series
- a **Calc** class with example scripts
- many more usefull methods

**Application:** These methods are used to **provide a solution to the Jane Street Puzzle "Andy's Morning Stroll" from July 2022** (https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/andys-morning-stroll-index/), which I handed in successfully. The step-by-step calculations can be executed in the Calc class while important adjacency matrices and graphs are stored in the main folder.

Format for storing adjacency matrice:
- the first line just contains an integer that specifies the dimension of the square matrix
- rows beginn and end with "|"
- entries are separated by " , "

Explanation of the puzzle solution:
We first need to compute the expected value of the length of a returning random walk on the football graph (football_AdjM_noWeights.txt).
Therefore, we compute the probability of a random walk to return after less or exact k steps. As it is impossible for a walker to 
return after 1 steps and the case of zero steps is excluded, we have to manipulate the
adjacency matrix $$A_0$$ (football_AdjM.txt) by deleting the edge to walk away from the starting point
