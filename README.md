# ReturningRandomWalk
Project for computations and simulations concerning returning-random-walks on graphs and transition matrices

This project contains:
- a **Graph** class to represent weighted graphs, initialize graphs from adjacency matrices and create adjacency matrices vise versa
- a **GraphWalker** class to simulate returning random walks
- a **GraphPrinter** class to print graphs as png- and dot-files
- a **Matrix** class to effectivly compute Matrix operations, store and load matrices
- a **MatPowerSeries** class to compute any matrix power series
- a **Calc** class with example scripts
- many more usefull methods

**Application:** These methods are used to **provide a solution to the Jane Street Puzzle "Andy's Morning Stroll" from July 2022** (https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/andys-morning-stroll-index/), which I handed in successfully. The step-by-step calculations can be executed in the Calc class while important adjacency matrices and graphs are stored in the main folder.


**Format for storing adjacency matrice:**
- the first line just contains an integer that specifies the dimension of the square matrix
- rows beginn and end with "|"
- entries are separated by " , "


**Explanation of the puzzle solution:**

We first need to compute the expected value of the length of a returning random walk 
on the football graph (football_AdjM_noWeights.txt). Therefore, we compute the probability of a random walk to return after less or exact k steps. As it is impossible for a walker to return after 1 steps and the case of zero steps is excluded, we have to manipulate the adjacency matrix $A_0$ (football_AdjM.txt) by deleting the edge to walk away from the starting point (set the enties (2,1),(3,1) and (4,1) to zero) to obtain the Transition Matrix A. Therefore, the probability of a random walk to return after less or exact k steps (k being greater than 1) can be computed by taking the first entry of the vector $$A^{k-1}v  ~~~ ,~~~ v=(0,1/3,1/3,1/3,0,...,0)^t$$ where $v$ is the "1th-step-probability-vector" derived by $A_0 e_1 =v$ and $e_1$ is the first standard-basis-vector. Therefore, we need to compute the power series $$\sum_{k=2}^\infty kA^{k-1}$$ By considering the geometric series, it can be shown that the series converges and its limit $E$ is "almost" equal to $(I-A)^{-1}$ (they differ in the entry (1,1), which is redundant when multiplying with $v$). Consequently, the expected value is the first entry of $Ev$.
