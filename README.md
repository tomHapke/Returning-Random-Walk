# ReturningRandomWalk
project for computations and simulations concerning returning-random-walks on graphs and transition matrices

This project contains:
- a **Graph** class to represent weighted graphs, initialize graphs from adjacency matrices and create adjacency matrices vise versa
- a **GraphWalker** class to simulate returning random walks
- a **GraphPrinter** class to print graphs as png- and dot-files
- a **Matrix** class to effectivly compute Matrix operations, store and load matrices
- a **MatPowerSeries** class to compute any matrix power series
- a **Calc** class with example scripts
- many more usefull methods

**Application:** These methods are used to **provide a solution to the Jane Street Puzzle "Andy's Morning Stroll" from July 2022** (https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/andys-morning-stroll-index/). The step-by-step calculations can be executed in the Calc class while important adjacency matrices and graphs are stored in the main folder.
